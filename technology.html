    <h1>Computer Technology</h1>
    <p>The term “information technology” gets thrown around a lot these days, but what does it actually mean and why is
        it important?

        Computer information technology, or IT, is a relatively new field that first emerged in the 1990s when computers
        became the basic tools used for work and everyday life. With the rise in computer use came the need for
        professionals that could develop and maintain their infrastructure. Computer information technology is often
        used to refer to technical support, but it’s become much more than that.

        IT is the development, maintenance, and use of computer systems and networks; but it encompasses a wide variety
        of tech-based disciplines that deal with information and data. Security and communication are huge elements of
        the technology industry, especially as systems become more public and technology continues to evolve.</p>
    <h1>Why Is Information Technology Important?</h1>
    <p>Technology impacts nearly every aspect of our lives, including the way we communicate, learn, socialize, work,
        bank, and more. IT ensures that this technology—and the networks and software that connect it—operates
        effectively. Thanks to IT, organizations and individuals enjoy better connections through faster, more
        accessible communication and increased productivity through easier access to information. From finance to
        farming, nearly every industry relies on information technology, and this dependence is only going to become
        stronger.</p>
    <h1>What Areas Does Information Technology Include?</h1>
    <p>IT includes many career paths and disciplines, but the following are the five main professional areas of IT:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> <b>Administration</b>handles the daily operations and deployment of software upgrades, security, and data
            management.</li>
        <li><b>Support</b> answers questions and troubleshoots problems. </li>
        <li><b>Applications</b> works with third-party applications to deliver critical business capabilities and
            services.
        </li>
        <li><b>Compliance</b> secures and monitors access to business data and applications to ensure they’re used
            according to
            business governance policies that meet regulatory requirements</li>
        <li><b>Cybersecurity</b> develops and utilizes software that secures computer-based systems and keeps digital
            assets
            safe.</li>
       
         
    </ol>
